Whether your e-mail boxes are hosted in a shared or a dedicated environment, the ability to deliver your messages is very important and may be optimized by the hosting provider and their users working together.

## Sender

- Check the sender's name and e-mail address.
- Use [identification protocols]({{< ref "e-mails/set-up-spf-dkim-dmarc">}}).
- The *SENDER FROM* setting needs to match the *FROM* in your headers.

## Addresses

- Delete addresses that do not exist or are idle.
- Check for spelling errors in addresses.
- Avoid mass sending.
- Fill-in the e-mail addresses in the `Cc` (or `Cci`) fields rather than one after the other in the `To` field for a mail shot.

## Content

- Avoid:
    - HTML,
    - using too much punctuation in succession,
    - writing in red,
    - writing in block capitals,
    - using [spam words](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30684/The-Ultimate-List-of-Email-SPAM-Trigger-Words.aspx).
- Pay attention to the e-mail subject.

## E-mailing

- Check that best practices are followed by answering "yes" to the following three questions:
    - Did the addressee explicitly consent to receiving these e-mails?
    - Were they informed that they would receive them?
    - Was the proposed content announced?
- Make unsubscribing easy.

## Scoring system

To avoid misuse and optimize the deliverability of e-mails sent by its servers, alwaysdata has always implemented a scoring system based on various criteria like the content and frequency of the messages sent.

The lower the score, the better the e-mail will be rated and the sending accepted. In shared servers, any e-mail with a score higher than _3_ will be blocked. In VPS and dedicated servers, the default value is _5_ and you can change it in the **SMTP > Settings** tab of your server.

Based on this scoring, the message will be sent via an IP address with a more or less good reputation. This way, by optimizing the quality of your e-mails and their content, you will have a better chance of avoiding your message being considered undesirable.

This system uses [SpamAssassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/). Depending on its score, it will trigger one of our anti-spam rules:

- `+1` SpamAssassin score: medium => SpamAssassin's score is between 0 and 3;
- `+2` SpamAssassin score: high => SpamAssassin score is between 3 and 8;
- `+3` SpamAssassin score: very high => SpamAssassin score is higher than 8.

And a set of rules specific to his system :

- `+1`: Mass e-mails: the account sent a large number of e-mails in the last few minutes,
- `+1`: Customer is [restricted]({{<ref "security/restricted-mode">}}),
- `+1`: New customer: the profile was recently created,
- `+X`: Too many bounces (in percentile): the account has sent too much e-mails that were sent back with an error in the last few hours. If the number exceeds *10%*, the system will add `+1` point and if it exceeds *30%*, `+2` points.

In order not to be dependent on abuse from other users being the same mail server you can rent a dedicated IP in the **Advanced > IP Addresses** tab of the account. You will be asked to specify emails sent by this IP according to the rating they will have received by the antispam.

## Notes

- The maximum size of e-mails sent is set at **50 Mbytes**.
