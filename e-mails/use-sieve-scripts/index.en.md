[Sieve](http://sieve.info/) is a language for filtering e-mails. It is used to add complex rules that cannot be added via the [filtering rules]({{< ref "e-mails/add-a-filter-rule">}}).

{{< fig "images/admin-panel_mailbox_sieve.en.png" "Administration interface: E-mails - Script Sieve" >}}

The final script is stored in the `$HOME/admin/mail/[domain]/[box]/filter_user.sieve` file in your account. You can read it to help debug your script, but you cannot edit it.
