To collect everything that is sent to addresses that do not exist in your domain, you can create a [catch-all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering#Methods) address.

## Warning

- This address may collect plenty of spam. We therefore recommend enabling the anti-spam function on this address.
- Error emails normally sent for addresses that do not exist will no longer be sent. It is up to you to warn senders who may believe that the address is a valid one.
