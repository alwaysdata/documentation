To customize the format of the HTTP access logs you need to first choose a name for your custom log file. To do this, fill-in the name of your choice in the **Filename** field in the **Logs** tab in your site (**Web > Sites** menu).

{{< fig "images/admin-panel_add-site-logs.en.png""Add a site: HTTP logs" >}}

This file will be stored in directory `$HOME/admin/logs/http/`.

The log lines are customized in the **Format** field. This field accepts character strings as well as a number of variables listed below. The syntax to use is `{variable_name}` to see its value appear in the access log lines.

The default format is as follows:

```txt
{request_hostname} {client_ip} - - [{completion_date:%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z}] {request} {status} {response_size} {referer} {user_agent}
```

The log lines are displayed as follows:

```txt
blog.alwaysdata.com 198.51.100.42 - - [17/Jul/2018:15:05:30 +0200] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 10975 "https://www.alwaysdata.com/fr/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.87 Safari/537.36"
```

## Specific cases

To display the user IP behind [Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170986-How-does-Cloudflare-handle-HTTP-Request-headers-) use `{request_header:cf-connecting-ip}`.
 
[^1]: May be formatted in line with the [strftime](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html?highlight=strftime#strftime-strptime-behavior) syntax. *Examples:* `{completion_date:{%d/%b/%Y}}` *→ 16/Jul/2018,* `{completion_date:{%H:%M:%S}}` *→ 12:04:07*
[^2]: Only one header can be specified. E.g.: `{request_header:authorization}`, `{response_header:age}` (to be used with the [HTTP cache]({{< ref "sites/http-cache" >}}))
