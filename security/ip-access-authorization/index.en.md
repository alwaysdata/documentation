To allow access to the alwaysdata administration interface by some IP addresses only, go to **Profile > Security**.

{{< fig "images/profile-security.en.png" >}}

Access will be blocked for any other connection from an IP address that is not filled-in.

If you made a mistake in the access IP addresses [contact alwaysdata](https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/#contact); you will be asked for proof of identity.
