Minor upgrades are regular, and even immediate (< 24 hours) when a severe security flaw is published. As all stable Linux distributions operate, **security patches are applied to the software we use without changing the version number**.

It **cannot** then be a determining factor to know if a vulnerability is fixed or not.

The main upgrade of our operating systems is done via an [automation tool]({{< ref "advanced/migrations" >}}) allowing to do it in an autonomous and flexible way per account.
