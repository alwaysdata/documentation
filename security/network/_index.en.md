## Firewall

### Incoming firewall

Users cannot listen to any port, only the necessary ones are open.

### Outgoing firewall

All of the ports are open without any filtering; you can therefore define your own uses without our help. Every connection is logged and will be temporarily blocked in case of misuse.

Users who own VPS and dedicated servers can [configure their firewall]({{< relref "configure-firewall" >}}) directly from their administration interface, via the server's **Firewall** menu.

## Intrusion prevention

alwaysdata uses [Fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/) as the intrusion system on all of its servers. This system analyzes the connection logs for the various services and will block the IP addresses for 30 minutes once they have made some ten failed connection attempts.

You can also implement an [application firewall]({{< ref "sites/waf">}}) directly in your account to protect your websites from malicious attacks.

## DDoS

A [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack aims to render a server, service or infrastructure unavailable. It may take different forms: bandwidth saturation, exhausting machine system resources, etc.

All of the alwaysdata servers are configured with [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) level 3/4 anti-DDoS protection. It is up to you to manage the application side.

VPS and dedicated server users can contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/) to get help with installation or for support.
