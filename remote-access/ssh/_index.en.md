# SSH

SSH, for [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), is a connection protocol that is secured by an exchange of encryption keys at the start of the connection. alwaysdata offers it in ALL of their environments.

## Connecting with SSH

|Information||
|--- |--- |
|Host|ssh-[account].alwaysdata.net|

These users can be configured in the **Remote access > SSH** tab in your alwaysdata administration interface. The *fingerprints* for the SSH server where the account is located are also found there.

### Using a terminal

Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```
$ ssh [user]@ssh-[account].alwaysdata.net
```

### Via the web

Useful when located after a firewall, our [web interface](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox) lets you use the SSH protocol from your browser. To use it, specify `https://ssh-[account].alwaysdata.net` in the address bar of your web browser.

Be aware however that this solution is hardly reliable and slow and does not replace a client.

{{% notice info %}}
This interface is not compatible with VPS and dedicated hosting.

## Tips

*Fingerprints* of our SSH servers are displayed in the **Remote access > SSH** menu of your administration interface.

An account's SSH server might change from time to time. In this case, you have to update the `known_hosts` file. You can use the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -R [hostname]
```
