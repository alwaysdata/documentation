To easily manage your server accounts, you can install global SSH keys in the **SSH keys** tab for your server. These are used to connect to any account without knowing the password.

Your public SSH key to copy in this form is given in the `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file on your computer. If you do not have one you can [generate it]({{< ref "remote-access/ssh/use-keys" >}}).
