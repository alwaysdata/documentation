Every account have a `$HOME/admin` directory, accessible in [FTP]({{< ref "remote-access/ftp" >}}), [SSH]({{< ref "remote-access/ssh" >}}), [SFTP]({{< ref "remote-access/sftp" >}}) or [WebDAV]({{< ref "remote-access/webdav" >}}).

It contains:

- _mail_: [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) mounting (public Cloud) or symbolic links (VPS & dedicated servers) to the account [e-mailboxes]({{< ref "e-mails" >}}),
- _config_,
- _logs_,
- _tmp_: temporary storage for your apps (we *strongly* recommend using this instead of `/tmp`),
- _backup_: read-only NFS mounting for [backups]({{< ref "backups" >}}) which are NOT stored locally.
