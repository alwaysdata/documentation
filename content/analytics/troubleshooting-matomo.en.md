## Customizing statistics

As our platform is entirely based on HTTP logs, customized settings cannot be added.

Hence there is no way to add JavaScript tags. You will need to look to install your own web statistics measurement software, which is possible via our [marketplace]({{< ref "marketplace/matomo" >}}).

## Differences in views with my Google Analytics statistics

This is linked to the difference in the counting method (JavaScript for Google Analytics, server logs for our own Matomo).

## Possible error messages

### You are logged in as 'user' but it seems you don't have any permission set in Matomo.

The creation of your Matomo user encounters a problem. Contact us via a [ticket](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add).
