Deleting a domain from the **Domains** tab does not destroy it. It simply inhibits its operation if it uses our DNS servers.

To easily relinquish a domain name, **simply do not renew it**. When a domain is not renewed, it is automatically deleted from the register after [various phases](domains/deadlines) (depending on the extension involved).

If it necessary to delete it before its expiry date, then contact our [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/). You will need to send us the [early deletion form](https://docs.gandi.net/en/_downloads/61ec67105f99e6f824c25924ea5d45f3/delete-en-v5.pdf) with the required identification evidence.
