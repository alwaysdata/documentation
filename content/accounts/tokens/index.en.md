Tokens are identifiers used to authenticate a user or a program calling our [API](api).

They can be generated in the **Profile** menu.

{{% notice tip %}}
For even more security generate one per application.
{{% /notice %}}

As for the alwaysdata administration interface you can give access to only [few IPs](security/ip-access-authorization).

They have the same [permissions](accounts/permissions) as the profile they are linked to.
