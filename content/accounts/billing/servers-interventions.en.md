If several changes occur at the same time, each intervention is billed with a ceiling of €600 excluding VAT.

Contact the [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/) for more information and plan the intervention.

Any operation cancelled within 24 hours before the intervention will be charged.

[^1]: For [Gold servers](accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices#managed-gold-servers), the price of the intervention is doubled. The ceiling is then €1200 excluding VAT.
