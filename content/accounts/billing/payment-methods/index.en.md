There are various ways to pay your alwaysdata invoices.

## Prepaid account

Every invoice issued debits your prepaid alwaysdata account for the amount owed. You need to credit this prepaid account to cover your debits.

We offer the following options:

- Credit card,
- PayPal,
- Bank transfer: our bank account details are provided on our invoices. Please include your *customer number* or *invoice number* in the transfer description.

{{% notice note %}}
Credits to your account by *bank transfer* will appear in your interface as soon as they have been processed by our team. This may take a few days.

### Accepted credit cards

The credit cards accepted by our payment service provider are: Visa and MasterCard.

## Direct debit

Enter your charge information - bank account or card number - in your administration access, in the **Billing > Payment methods** menu.

This means of payment will be automatically debited the amount due. You no longer need to worry about paying for your alwaysdata hosting.

When you activate direct debit on your bank account, please provide your bank with a [direct debit authorization form](http://static.alwaysdata.com/docs/Prelevement.png).

## Chorus Pro

Hosting invoices can be made available on the French [Chorus Pro](https://portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr/) portal.

To do this, enter your SIRET number and service code (if your administration uses such a code) in the **Billing > Payment Methods > Settings** menu.

Invoices will then be automatically sent to the Chorus Pro portal upon issuance.

Further information may be requested at the invoice level (such as a commitment number).
