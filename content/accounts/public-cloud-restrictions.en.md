Here is a - non-exhaustive - list of restrictions:

- use SSH servers to run bots and daemons,
- using the account for:
	- do [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) ;
	- send [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spam#European_Union) ;
		- any message must be sent with the **express consent** (_opt-in_) of the recipient,
		- using a list purchased from a third party is therefore considered to be spam,
		- [several questions to ask yourself before launching the emailing](e-mails/delivery#emailing),
	- any other illegal use.

If any of these restrictions are violated, we reserve the right to suspend and/or cancel the profile.

## Free plan

To be added to the rules presented above:

- having a number of free accounts for the same user,
    - pay attention to not confuse account and features (websites, domains, e-mail addresses, databases, etc.).
    - An account may host as many features (e.g. as many sites) as you wish.
- using the free account to make *remote connections* to one or more *databases*,
- using the free account to host processes that consumes server resources - like proxies of mass e-mailing solutions,
- using the free account for *commercial/lucratives goals*. E.g. it’s strictly prohibited to host company’s emails or website; to host ads that could generate incomes; to sell products on the hosted websites and mailboxes, etc.

{{% notice note %}}
Only the `alwaysdata.net` account address can be used to [create *websites*](/sites/add-a-site/) on the Free plan. To use your own domain, it is therefore necessary to take a paid plan.

You can, however, use your domain to [host *emails*](/e-mails/create-an-e-mail-address/) or [create *DNS records*](/domains/add-dns/) on the Free plan.

Your profile may also be automatically suspended after your administration interface has been *[idle for X days](accounts/alerts-notifications#lack-of-activity)*.
