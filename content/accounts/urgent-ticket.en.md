Opening an urgent ticket, reserved for customers with a dedicated server will immediately trigger taking charge by an engineer 24/7.

If the ticket covers a problem covered by our *service guarantee*, we will work to resolve it as a matter of priority. This does not trigger any extra charge for our customer.

If however the problem is not our responsibility, then the intervention will be charged for at a cost of *€95 excl. VAT* with no prior quote: simply opening the ticket in urgent mode represents acceptance of this charge. We will however, insomuch as possible, attempt to assist you in resolving the problem.

## Problems covered by the service guarantee

In the vast majority of cases, our monitoring automatically detects anomalies covered by our service guarantee. Consequently, there is no need to open the ticket as our team is already alerted.

Examples (a non-exhaustive list):

- A service administered by alwaysdata has stopped working (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, SSH, etc.),
- The modifications made from the alwaysdata administration system are not properly taken into account,
- You cannot access the daily backups from the server.

## Problems NOT covered by the service guarantee

Examples (a non-exhaustive list):

- any problem resulting from incorrect server use by the user,
- abnormal behavior by the user's applications,
- any performance problem not caused by a server or network malfunction,
- server resource saturation by users applications,
- any network malfunction whose origin is not alwaysdata's responsibility,
- any general request for help.
