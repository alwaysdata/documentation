[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) is a cryptographic protocol to secure Internet communications.

Three presets for HTTP connections are available:

- _Modern_: only TLS 1.3. Compatible with latest browsers.
- _Intermediate_: TLS versions higher than 1.2 are activated. Compatible with most web browsers.
- _Old_: all TLS versions are activated. Compatible with olders web browsers.

The _Intermediate_ profile is activated by default on alwaysdata's servers.
