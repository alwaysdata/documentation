[Sieve](http://sieve.info/) is a language for filtering e-mails. It is used to add complex rules that cannot be added via the [filtering rules](e-mails/add-a-filter-rule).

{{< fig "images/admin-panel_mailbox_sieve.en.png" "Administration interface: E-mails - Script Sieve" >}}

The final script is stored in the `$HOME/admin/mail/[domain]/[box]/filter_user.sieve` file in your account. You can read it to help debug your script, but you cannot edit it.

## Examples

### Add a `<SPAM>` prefix to the subject of an e-mail comprising a key word to define (whether in the subject or in the body text)

```
require ["editheader", "variables", "body"] ;
if allof (
header :contains "subject" "word",
header :matches "Subject" "*"
)
{
deleteheader "Subject";
addheader "Subject" "<SPAM> ${1}";
}
elsif allof (
body :content "text" :contains "word",
header :matches "Subject" "*"
)
{
deleteheader "Subject";
addheader "Subject" "<SPAM> ${1}";
}
```

### Use headers in variables for automatic reponses

```
require ["variables", "vacation"];

# Store subject header in variable
if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
        set "subj" "**${1}**";
}

# Auto-reply
vacation
  :days 1
  :subject "Out-of-office [Was: ${subj}]"
"Hello,
We've received your last message:

${subj}

We're currently out-of-office and will reply soon.";
```
