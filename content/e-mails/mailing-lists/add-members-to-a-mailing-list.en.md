To add members to a mailing list, you must use the [Postorius management interface](https://mailman.alwaysdata.com/). Connect using an administration email address that you will have defined at the [creation of your mailing list](/e-mails/mailing-lists/create-a-mailing-list).

Once identified, go to the management section of the concerned mailing list by clicking on its name.

## Adding members manually

To manually add members to the list, go to the **Mass Operations → Mass subscribe** section.

Add email addresses in the input box, one email address per line. Accepted formats are listed below the section.

By default, email addresses:

- *pre-confirmed* : users will be automatically registered without confirmation from them.
- *pre-approved*: moderators will not have to revalidate the subscription.

Addresses are not *pre-verified* by default (they must prove that their address is correct by sending a message), you can disable this step by checking the associated box.
