The server's **SMTP > Waiting queue** menu shows you e-mails waiting to be sent (incoming and outgoing e-mails) and allows you:
- via the magnifying glass - ðŸ”Ž - in front of the desired e-mail:
    - to access the full message (including headers),
    - to access the logs explaining the reason for the temporary blocking,
- force the sending of certain e-mails,
- to delete e-mails from the waiting list (which would be problematic in the event of [sending spam](/e-mails/react-to-spam-mailing/)).
