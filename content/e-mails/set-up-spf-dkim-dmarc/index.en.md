Here are three methods for authenticating your e-mails and thereby reducing abusive e-mail use (spam, phishing, etc.).

## Sender Policy Framework

[SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) makes a `TXT` type DNS request to the sender's domain ("*MAIL FROM*" in the message headers) to find out the list of servers allowed to send e-mails and compare it with the IP address of the sender's server.

### Parameters

|Mechanism||
|--- |--- |
|ALL|Default result|
|A|An IN A (or AAAA) record that can be resolved as the sender's address|
|IP4|IPv4 range|
|IP6|IPv6 range|
|MX|A Mail eXchanger record pointing to the sender's address|
|EXISTS|The domain is resolved at any address|
|INCLUDE|An included rule passes the test|
|PTR|The IP address domain corresponds to the specified domain and the latter points to the IP in return|

|Qualifiers||
|--- |--- |
|+|Favorable result|
|?|Neutral result|
|~|Slight "SOFTMAIL" failure (e-mail accepted but marked)|
|-|Total failure (e-mail normally rejected)|

|Modifiers||
|--- |--- |
|exp=some.example.org|To get the reason for the failure results|
|redirect=some.example.org|To link to a rule record in another domain|

{{% notice warning %}}
This technology may have an impact on e-mail redirects as the sender server is not necessarily the e-mail server belonging to the original e-mail sender.
{{% /notice %}}

#### At alwaysdata

A SPF record is created by default and can be found in the **DNS records** tab for the domain:

{{< fig "images/spf-record.png" "SPF record" >}}

- `include:_spf.alwaysdata.com` **explicitly allows our servers** to send e-mails,
- `~all` sends a slight "SOFTMAIL" failure result for the other sender servers.

 If the domain doesnâ€™t use alwaysdataâ€™s DNS servers, you must then, in the DNS service provider, add `include:_spf.alwaysdata.com` to the SPF registration.

- [RFC 7372 - point 3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7372)
- [RFC 4408](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408)

## DomainKeys Identified Mail

[DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) is used to authenticate the domain name by adding a signature to all of the outgoing e-mails. Concretely, this works with two keys:

- a private key that is known - and kept secret - from the domainâ€™s mail delivery servers;
- a public key that corresponds to a DNS registration of the `TXT` type.

{{< fig "images/globalcyberalliance-dkim.en.png" "DKIM: explanatory diagram" >}}

### Setup

To generate a pair of keys, go to **Domains > Details of [example.org] - ðŸ”Ž > Configuration**.

{{< fig "images/admin-panel_domain-configuration.en.png" "Administration interface: configure DKIM" >}}
{{< fig "images/admin-panel_dkim.en.png" "Administration interface: DKIM configuration result" >}}

 The `TXT` record will automatically be created and available in the **DNS records** tab:

{{< fig "images/dkim-record.png" "DKIM record" >}}

 If the domain doesnâ€™t use alwaysdataâ€™s DNS servers, this record must be recopied with your DNS service provider.

- [RFC 7372 - point 3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7372)

## Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance

[DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) is a protocol that standardizes authentication by telling the addressees what actions to take should one of the authentication methods fails. It will check that:

- the domain corresponds to the pair of DKIM keys (field *d=*),
- the sender server is specified in the SPF record for the domain (*MAIL FROM*),
- the domain is in the e-mail's *FROM* field.

{{% notice info %}}
To use DMARC, DKIM and SPF must already be implemented.
{{% /notice %}}

### Parameters

|Variables||
|--- |--- |
|v|Protocol version: v=DMARC1 (required)|
|pct|Percentage of messages to filter (default: 100)|
|adkim|Coherency with DKIM|
||s = strict mode - the DKIM signature domain must precisely match the FROM|
||r = relax mode (default)|
|aspf|Coherency with SPF (s or r)|
|p|Procedure in case of failure - main domain (required)|
||none = delivers the e-mail normally|
||quarantine = treats the e-mail as suspect (spam score, flag, etc.)|
||reject = rejects the e-mail|
|sp|Procedure in case of failure - subdomain (none, quarantine or reject)|
|ruf|Recipient of the detailed failure reports|
|fo|Conditions for sending a detailed report|
||1 = DKIM and/or SPF failure|
||d = DKIM failure|
||s = SPF failure|
||0 = DKIM and SPF failure (default)|
|rua|Recipients of aggregated failure reports|

To implement it, a `TXT` DNS record needs to be created. At alwaysdata, you will find it in the **DNS records** tab of the domain:
