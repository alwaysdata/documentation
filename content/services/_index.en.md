You can register services: custom programs running in a headless mode (i.e. without any user interaction). Unlike a command launched by-hand trough SSH, those services will be restarted automatically by the system when the service stops.

Those services are declared in the [administration panel](https://admin.alwaysdata.com)'s  **Advanced > Services**.

{{< fig "admin-panel_create-service.en.png" "" >}}

The ports' range `8300` to `8499`, as well as the hostname `services-[account].alwaysdata.net`[^1] are reserved to those services.

- [API reference](https://api.alwaysdata.com/v1/service/doc/)

## Use services

- It must runs in `foreground`, not fork and leave [^2].
- When needing to be reached from an external application, bind it to `::` (_IPv6_) and a port from `8300` to `8499`.
- Log files for running services are located at `$HOME/admin/logs/services/`, containing services' outputs.
	- An extract of those logs is presented in the administrationâ€™s interface (**Logs** - ðŸ“„).
- Current processes are accessible via the **Advanced > Processes > Services** menu.
- The restart of a service sends the `SIGHUP` signal.
- If a service fails repeatedly within a short period of time, it will be automatically disabled.
- The language versions used by default are those specified in the **Environment** menu of the administration interface. It is possible to choose another version using the *Environment variables*.

The optional *Monitoring command* allows you to specify a command used to check the service's status. When this command returns an error code, the service is restarted. E.g. you can ping the service on the assigned port (i.e. *8300*):

```sh
$ nc -z services-[account].alwaysdata.net 8300
```

There is no network filtering, anyone can connect to your services. Make sure your services have an authentication mechanism if necessary.

### [Public Cloud](accounts/billing/public-cloud-prices) users

- Services are executed on a distinct servers than SSH and HTTP servers.
- Their resources use must remain fair.
- The services will not be available on IPv4, only on IPv6.

### [Private Cloud](accounts/billing/private-cloud-prices) users

- Range port `8300` to `8499` are *not* accessible from the external network. You can expose them to Internet using a [firewall rule](security/network/configure-firewall).
- You can use other ports ; for example the default port of the application.
