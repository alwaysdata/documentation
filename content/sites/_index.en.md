Any website address hosted on alwaysdata servers **must** be declared in **Web > Sites**. Choose the [language](languages) or type of you choice and configure them.

You can have as many sites as you wish in a single account. Note that this does entail a security risk as isolation takes place at the account level.

The alwaysdata administrationâ€™s interface presents an excerpt of logs (**Logs** - ðŸ“„), and the current processes are found in the **Advanced > Processes > Web** menu.

{{% notice note %}}
If your script needs to allow some IPs, allow these [IP adresses ranges](security/ip-ranges).
{{% /notice %}}
