To easily manage your server accounts, you can install global SSH keys in the **SSH keys** tab for your server. These are used to connect to any account without knowing the password.

{{< fig "images/admin-interface_global-ssh-keys.en.png" "Administration interface: global SSH keys" >}}

Your public SSH key to copy in this form is given in a file of the `$HOME/.ssh` directory of your computer (for example `$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`). If you do not have one you can [generate it](remote-access/ssh/use-keys).
