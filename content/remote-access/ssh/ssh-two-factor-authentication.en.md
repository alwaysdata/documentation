You will need to [contact the customer support team](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add) to install the `google-authenticator`[^1] tool.

Once `google-authenticator` is installed on the server, here is how you activate the 2-factor authentication for each account:

1. Log in to your account with SSH;

2. Create a new secret key,

    - for [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password) verification:
    ```shell
    $ google-authenticator -tDfuw 3
    ```
    - for [HOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_one-time_password) verification:
    ```shell
    $ google-authenticator -cfuw 3
    ```
    
The script will then send back to you:
 - a QR code and the new secret key to enter in your password generating application[^2],
 - several emergency codes for recovering your code.

For TOTP verifications, you will need to indicate the code sent by your software.

> The installation is complete, the SSH 2-factor authentication is now activated.
