# Lua

The way [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Lua on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [proposed versions](languages/lua/configuration#supported-versions) range from 5.1 to 5.4,
- the [environment configuration](languages/lua/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Sailor](https://github.com/sailorproject/sailor) and [Lapis](https://leafo.net/lapis/) frameworks are for example compatible with our architecture.
