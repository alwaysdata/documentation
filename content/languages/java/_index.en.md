The way [Java](https://www.java.com/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Java on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions](languages/java/configuration#supported-versions) are 8/11/17/21,
- the [environment configuration](languages/java/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.

All programs using the *JVM* ([Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), [Spring](https://spring.io/), [Struts](https://struts.apache.org/) or [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) for example) can run via the [user program](sites/user-program).
