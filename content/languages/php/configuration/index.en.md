## Supported versions

||
|---|
|8.4 \|8.3 \| 8.2 \| 8.1 \| 8.0|
|7.4 \| 7.3 \| 7.2 \| 7.1 \| 7.0|
|5.6 \| 5.5 \| 5.4 \| 5.3 \| 5.2|
|4.4|

The default version can be changed from the alwaysdata administration, under **Environment > PHP**. This is the version that is especially used when you start `php`.

Versions are not necessarily [already installed](languages#versions).

## Parameters (php.ini)

By default, the `php.ini` file activates a number of essential extensions and defines some basic parameters. This file is accessible in read from the following location `$HOME/admin/config/php/php.ini`. Here is its content (for an account configured on PHP version 8.2):

```ini
; Core settings
max_execution_time = 120
max_input_time = 60
memory_limit = 256M

post_max_size = 256M
upload_max_filesize = 256M

output_buffering = 4096
expose_php = Off
default_socket_timeout = 10
date.timezone = "Europe/Paris"

log_errors = On
error_log = /home/test/admin/logs/php/php.log
ignore_repeated_errors = On
ignore_repeated_source = On


mysql.default_socket = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

session.save_path = /home/test/admin/tmp
upload_tmp_dir = /home/test/admin/tmp

; Extensions
extension_dir = "/usr/alwaysdata/php/8.2/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20220829"

extension = ctype.so
extension = curl.so
extension = dom.so
extension = gd.so
extension = gettext.so
extension = iconv.so
extension = json.so
extension = mbstring.so
extension = openssl.so
extension = posix.so
extension = simplexml.so
extension = tokenizer.so
extension = xml.so
extension = xmlwriter.so
extension = xsl.so
extension = zip.so
extension = zlib.so

extension = mysqli.so
extension = pgsql.so
extension = pdo.so
extension = pdo_mysql.so
extension = pdo_pgsql.so

extension = fileinfo.so
extension = phar.so

; Zend extensions
zend_extension = /usr/alwaysdata/php/8.2/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20220829/opcache.so
opcache.lockfile_path = /home/test/admin/tmp
```

To change this `php.ini`, go to the **Environment > PHP** section (or if you want to manage it at the website level in **Web > Sites**). All of the directives that you define will be added to the initial `php.ini` file and can therefore overwrite the default values. There is no limit to what you can define, every PHP option is accessible.

You can also create `.user.ini` files to only apply parameters to some directories.

## HTTP deployment

For a PHP application to be accessible via the web, create a site in the **Web > Sites** section of the alwaysdata administration by selecting the **PHP** type.

### Versions management

Managing PHP versions per site results in a higher RAM consumption per account. Websites cannot then share PHP processes. It is therefore recommended :
- to prioritize the management of PHP at the account level (Environment section),
- to use few different versions per account,
- if you have to use several and a certain number of sites use the same version, to group their php.ini via the global php.ini and to switch them on the PHP default version.
