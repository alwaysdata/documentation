The way [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Rust on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Rust is a compiled language that does not need an interpreter to run the programs but [version](languages/rust/configuration#version) 1.86 is available.
- Its [HTTP deployment](languages/rust/configuration#deployment-http) is simple.

Our marketplace provides the installation of the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework and lot of other applications are compatible.
