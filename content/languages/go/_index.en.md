The way [Go](https://golang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Go on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Go is a compiled language that does not need an interpreter to run the programs but [version](languages/go/configuration#version) 1.22 is available.
- Its [HTTP deployment](languages/go/configuration#deployment-http) is simple.

Our marketplace provides the installation of the [Macaron](https://go-macaron.com/) framework and lot of other applications are compatible. For example, [Beego](https://github.com/beego/beego), [Iris](https://iris-go.com/), [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/) or [Revel](https://revel.github.io/).
