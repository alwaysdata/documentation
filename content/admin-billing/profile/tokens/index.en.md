Tokens are identifiers used to authenticate a user or a program calling our [API](/development/api).

They can be generated in the **Profile** menu.

{{< fig "images/profile-token.en.png" "Managing tokens">}}

It is necessary to have enabled [two-factor authentication](/admin-billing/profile/two-factor-authentication) to generate/modify your tokens.

{{% notice tip %}}
For even more security generate one per application.
{{% /notice %}}

As for the alwaysdata administration interface you can give access to only [few IPs](/admin-billing/profile/ip-access-authorization).

They have the same [permissions](/admin-billing/permissions) as the profile they are linked to.
