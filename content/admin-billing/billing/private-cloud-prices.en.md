Due to the current situation in the IT market, the hardware used on our servers is experiencing a significant increase in costs and extended delivery times. **The following prices are therefore only indicative.** Please contact our [sales team](https://www.alwaysdata.com/en/contact/) or our [customer service team](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support) for more information.

For any Private Cloud configuration order, the installation of the server is done after validation of the contracts and payment of the first invoice. There are no installation fees.

*Private Cloud* is a fully managed and operated servers offer. Our team handles the installation, configuration, and deployment of the platforms. You don't have to manage the systems administation part.
