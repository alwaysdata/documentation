The way [Deno](https://deno.land/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Deno on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Several [versions](/web-hosting/languages/deno/configuration#supported-versions) are available.
- the [environment configuration](/web-hosting/languages/deno/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.
