The way [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Elixir on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions](/web-hosting/languages/elixir/configuration#supported-versions) range from 1.13 to 1.18,
- the [environment configuration](/web-hosting/languages/elixir/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.

Our marketplace provides the installation of the [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework.
