The way [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Ruby on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions](/web-hosting/languages/ruby/configuration#supported-versions) range from 1.8 to 4.0,
- the [environment configuration](/web-hosting/languages/ruby/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) frameworks are part of our autoinstallable applications.
