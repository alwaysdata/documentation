The way [Python](https://www.python.org) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Python on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisionned versions](/web-hosting/languages/python/configuration#supported-versions) range from 2.4 to 3.14,
- the [environment configuration](/web-hosting/languages/python/configuration#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/) frameworks are part of our autoinstallable applications and many other applications are also compatible. For example, [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/), [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/), [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/), [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) or even [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).
