You may need to take down your site the time required for maintenance or unavailability: this function is not available from the administration interface. There are however simple solutions for making this happen:

-   Creating an index file (remember to rename the one for your application) indicating that the site is currently undergoing maintenance or disabled. All you need to do is the reverse action once your site can again be made accessible,

-   Deleting the site from the **Web > Sites** section for the length of the down time and redeclaring it later on:
    {{< fig "images/admin-panel_delete-site.en.png" "Administration interface: deleting a site" >}}

-   If you use a CMS application like WordPress, Joomla (.etc) an option is generally available right from their administration interface.
