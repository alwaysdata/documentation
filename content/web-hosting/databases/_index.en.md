The DBMS (**D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystems) that we offer are **entirely hosted** in all of our offers: we install, configure, maintain and secure your databases. This way you only need to handle the interactions between your applications and your databases.

- [MariaDB/MySQL](/web-hosting/databases/mariadb)
- [PostgreSQL](/web-hosting/databases/postgresql)
- [RabbitMQ](/web-hosting/databases/rabbitmq)

On Private Cloud plans:

- [ElasticSearch](/web-hosting/databases/elasticsearch)
- [Memcached](/web-hosting/databases/memcached)
- [Redis](/web-hosting/databases/redis)

{{% notice info %}}
For security reasons, it is only possible to create databases and database users from the administration interface or from our [API](/development/api). Therefore this is not possible using a third party application (e.g. phpMyAdmin).
