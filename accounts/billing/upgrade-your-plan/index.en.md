To change the offer, go to **Accounts > Change** the relevant account:

{{< fig "images/list-accounts.en.png" "Administration interface: list of accounts" >}}.

You can change the *[pack]({{< ref "accounts/billing/public-cloud-prices" >}})* and the *commitment period*. The invoice for the new subscription is generated the next day and you will have 30 days to pay it.


In the following cases, contact [support](https://admin.alwaysdata.com/support/add/):

- Take out a VPS or dedicated server (or change its configuration / commitment period),
- Move the accounts to a VPS or dedicated server (and vice versa): the accounts are "black boxes" that the support team can easily move from one server to another without touching its content,
- Change the commitment period for an IP subscription.

## Prorata refund

A prorata refund is automatically made to the *prepaid account*:

- when changing to a higher or lower offer,
- when migrating accounts to VPS/dedicated servers.

This refund can only be used to pay future invoices.
