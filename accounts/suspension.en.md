Your profile may be suspended (the **Account suspended** statement appears on your site and the various services FTP, SQL, etc. will be blocked). This may occur for a number of reasons.

## Lack of activity

In the case of a **free account**, if you have not connected to your [administration interface](https://admin.alwaysdata.com) *within the last X days*[^1], then your profile will be suspended automatically. Simply connecting to the administration interface will lift this suspension and your site and your services will become available right away.

## Illicit content

By registering with our site and therefore creating a profile, you commit to strict compliance with French law regarding digital content. Among these activities, **any proven illegal use will result in the immediate suspension of your account**. Some examples:

  - sending spam,
  - hosting phishing sites,
  - hosting counterfeit sites (dofus, Habbo, etc.),
  - attempts to hack outside systems from alwaysdata servers.

## Failure to comply with the terms of sale/terms of use

Failure to comply with our *general terms of sale/general terms of use* will result in a suspension of your profile. For example, having more than one free account is not acceptable. We do however accept a maximum of two free accounts if you have at least one paying account.

In this kind of situation, you will be sent an **alert** to prompt you to resolve your situation.

[^1]: - a profile created in less than a year must connect every 120 days,
    - a profile created between 1 and 4 years must connect every 6 months,
    - a profile with 4 years of age, one connection per year is required.
