Web apps or services sometimes need to periodically run tasks, commands or call up URLs with no user interaction. To manage this point you should save a scheduled task.

Our platform is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and its [crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) but allows them to be directly managed from our [administration interface](https://admin.alwaysdata.com) - menu **Advanced > Scheduled tasks** - making their use easier.

Two kinds of information need to be provided:

- The one or more commands that you wish to run or the URLs you wish to request,
- Task frequency: you can specify a fixed time or an interval.
