Via the **Advanced > Scheduled tasks** menu in your administration interface, enter the commands that you wish to run, the URL that you wish to access at regular intervals and define the task repeat periods.

Important:

- If the task is scheduled at a certain frequency but the execution of the previous task is not finished, the current one will be ignored,
- Tasks are started during the set minute. In other words a task scheduled to start every day at 6:30 will start between 6:30:00 and 6:30:59.
- A log is created automatically and is available from the `$HOME/admin/logs/jobs/` directory. It gives you the start and end of the task.
- For accounts on the public Cloud, the consumption should remain reasonable. If the scheduled task is major processing, then reduce its frequency.

Even if it is not advisable, users of dedicated and VPS servers have also access to the `crontab -e` command. The two systems are separate.

## Examples

### WordPress

Every ten minutes, the [WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/cron/event/run/) tool starts to run the scheduled tasks:

alwaysdata administration interface:

- *value*: `php $HOME/wordpress/htdocs/wp cron event run --due-now`
- *frequency*: second choice - Every 10 minutes

Equivalent crontab syntax:

```
*/10 * * * * php $HOME/wordpress/htdocs/wp cron event run --due-now
```

### tt-rss

[Refreshing an RSS backend](https://git.tt-rss.org/fox/tt-rss/wiki/UpdatingFeeds#periodical-updating-from-crontab-using-update-script-updatephp---feeds) with TT-rss, every day at 10:30:

alwaysdata administration interface:

- *value*: `php $HOME/tt-rss/update.php --feeds --quiet`
- *frequency*: first choice - Every day at 10:30

Equivalent crontab syntax:

```

```

## Troubleshooting

- `source venv/bin/activate && python` is specific to [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) and can't function. To replace per `venv/bin/python`.
