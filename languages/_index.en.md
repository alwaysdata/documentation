# Languages

For all of the information on the technologies driven by servers:

- [Deno]({{< ref "languages/deno" >}})
- [Elixir]({{< ref "languages/elixir" >}})
- [Go]({{< ref "languages/go" >}})
- [Java]({{< ref "languages/java" >}})
- [Lua]({{< ref "languages/lua" >}})
- [Node.js]({{< ref "languages/nodejs" >}})
- [PHP]({{< ref "languages/php" >}})
- [Python]({{< ref "languages/python" >}})
- [Ruby]({{< ref "languages/ruby" >}})

Other interpreters and languages also can be run through the [user program]({{< ref "sites/user-program" >}}).

## Versions

Language versions are, to limit disk space consumption, **automatically installed on demand**.[^1]

To run the binary of a language (e.g., `python`), you simply need to run `python`. This will internally call `/usr/bin/python`, which is a *wrapper* of the "correct" version of python (the one defined in your environment).

The binaries are stored in `/usr/alwaysdata/[language]/[version]`. The directory of each version does not necessarily exist until you call the binary of the version in question: so you should not rely on `/usr/alwaysdata` to know if a version is available but you can use:

```
$ alwrapper get_versions [language]
```

[^1]: `[language]` and `[version]` have to be replaced by the name of the language/version.
