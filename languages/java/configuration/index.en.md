## Supported Versions

| Major versions |
| -------------- |
| 14             |
| 11             |
| 8              |

The default version is Java 14. This is the version that is especially used when you start `java`.

Versions are not necessarily [already installed]({{< ref "languages#versions" >}}).

## Binary to use

To use a Java version that is different from the default one:

- go on **Environment > Java**,
- or use `JAVA_VERSION=[VERSION] java` (replacing `[VERSION]` with the desired Java version).

## Environment

Your Java environment starts off empty, with no ready installed libraries.

## HTTP deployment

To deploy an HTTP application with Java, create a *[User program]({{< ref "sites/user-program" >}})* type site in the **Web > Sites** section.

{{< fig "images/user-program.en.png" "User Program Site Type">}}

You need to specify the command that will start your Java application, for example:

```
$ java -Xmx512m -jar jenkins.war --httpListenAddress=0.0.0.0 --httpPort=$PORT
```

{{% notice warning %}}
Your application must absolutely listen to IP `0.0.0.0` and the port shown in the site configuration in the *Command* field or use the IP and PORT environment variables.
