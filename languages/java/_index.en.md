# Java

The way [Java](https://www.java.com/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Java on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions]({{< ref "languages/java/configuration">}}#versions-supported) range from 1.7 to 1.10 ([v2017]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})) and 1.8/1.11/1.14 ([v2020]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})),
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/java/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.
