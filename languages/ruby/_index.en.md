# Ruby

The way [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Ruby on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisioned versions]({{< ref "languages/ruby/configuration">}}#versions-supported) range from 1.8 to 2.6 ([v2017]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})) and 2.7 ([v2020]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})),
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/ruby/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) frameworks are part of our autoinstallable applications.
