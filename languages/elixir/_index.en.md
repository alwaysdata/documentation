# Elixir

The way [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Elixir on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [proposed versions]({{< ref "languages/elixir/configuration">}}#versions-supported) range from 1.5 to 1.7 (Jessie) and 1.6 to 1.10 (Buster - new accounts),
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/elixir/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework is one of our autoinstallable applications.
