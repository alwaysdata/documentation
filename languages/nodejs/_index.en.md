# Node.js

The way [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Node.js on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- the [provisoned versions]({{< ref "languages/nodejs/configuration">}}#versions-supported) range from 6 to 15,
- the [environment configuration]({{< ref "languages/nodejs/configuration" >}}#environment) is easy to set up.

The [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework is one of our autoinstallable applications.
