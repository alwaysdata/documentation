# Go

The way [Go](https://golang.org/) works at alwaysdata is very standard. If you are used to using Go on a Unix system, e.g. Linux, then you already know almost everything you need.

- Go is a compiled language that does not need an interpreter to run the programs but [versions]({{< ref "languages/go/configuration">}}#version) 1.7 ([v2017]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})) and 1.11 ([v2020]({{< ref "accounts/version" >}})) is available.
- Its [HTTP deployment]({{< ref "languages/go/configuration">}}#deployment-http) is simple.

The [Macaron](https://go-macaron.com/) framework is one of our autoinstallable applications.
