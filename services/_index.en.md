Web apps or services sometimes need to run background tasks or deamons with no user interaction. To manage this point you should save a scheduled task.

These services are supervised via the **Advanced > Services** menu of the [administration interface](https://admin.alwaysdata.com).

Two type of services can be launched:

- a service that runs alone - that we don't need to be connected. Examples: Celery, New Relic.
- a service that one or several applications need to connect. In that case, you will need to listen on a port between `8300` and `8499` and use the account hostname - of the form `services-[compte].alwaysdata.net`[^1]. To be configured at the client level. Example : Redis.

Unlike a task manually launched in SSH, these services will be restarted automatically by the system if the service is stopped.

The *Monitoring command* field allows you to create a command to restart the service in case of failure. It can, for example, verify that the service is listening on the assigned port by using (for a service that uses the 8300 port):

```sh
$ nc -z services-[account].alwaysdata.net 8300
```
