Most migrations imply a complete change on the server. For example, migration to a new version of our software infrastructure will call for the complete reinstallation of the server.

In a shared environment, during a migration, the accounts are migrated to a new server that runs the new version. When you have a dedicated or VPS server, this is not possible: you only have one server.

## Required migrations

To avoid the need to suddenly migrate your server and therefore all of the accounts located there, migrations take place in a number of steps:

- You prepare the migrations for all of your accounts (like shared ones),
- Once you are ready to start actually migrating your accounts, we will make a transit server available with the same configuration as your dedicated or VPS server,
- Then you can migrate each of your accounts, one by one. They will be moved to this transit server,
- Once all of your accounts have been migrated to this transit server, your initial server will be reinstalled to run on the new version of our software infrastructure,
- Lastly, all of your accounts then located on the transit server, will be transparently moved back to the initial server.

While your server is being reinstalled, its IP addresses will be rerouted to the transit server so that your services remain accessible as usual. A short down time for these IPs (lasting around a minute) will however need to be allowed for. If you use our DNS servers, the traffic will in any case be redirected ahead of time to the transit server's IP addresses so you will not encounter any down time.

The transit server will be made available at no extra cost for a period of up to one week. If you have not finished migrating all of your accounts by the end of the week, the transit server will be billed at the same price as your dedicated/VPS server (prorata to the number of days) â€” in addition to the normal server that is still charged normally.

The availability of the transit server will depend on availability at the time of your request. You may therefore have to wait until a server is released.

## Optional migrations

Some migrations relating to only one service in our infrastructure (e.g. database management servers) may be offered.

In this case, no preparation, no test is possible and the update is performed directly on the server. You can still open an account on a shared server if this service is on offer there, to test some of your applications.
